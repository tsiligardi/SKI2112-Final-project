# SKI2112-Final-project
This repository contains the code for the final project of SKI2112.


The algorithm is based on the work of Rasmussen et al., Improved methods to deduct trip legs and mode from travel surveys using wearable GPS devices: A case study from the Greater Copenhagen area, 2015.

The code contains two versions of the algorithm: one considering the acceleration and one excluding it. The first version is more precise, however, it gave wrong results due to inaccuracy in the data used. On the other hand, the second one is not as precise in distinguishing the mean of transports, but it gave more correct results with the data used.
